  <p class="flex-item">Lonely Table, Anja Ngozi and The Vinyl Factory present a genre-defying collaborative compilation
    album, Untitled, exploring the enduring themes presented in the culturally iconic work of Jean-Michel Basquiat..</p>
  <p class="flex-item">The LP features seven exclusive collaborations, from a carefully curated selection of eighteen
    emerging and established musicians from the UK's explosive music scene including Kojey Radical, Mala, Nubya Garcia,
    Lord Tusk, Joe Armon-Jones, LayFullstop, Coby Sey and Shabaka Hutchings.</p>
  <p class="flex-item"> Many of the featured artists attended the Barbican Centre exhibition Basquiat: Boom for Real,
    the first large-scale exhibition of Basquiat’s work in the UK, before being given a blank canvas to collaborate on
    tracks in response to his legacy.</p>
  <p class="flex-item"> Basquiat once said “I don't think about art when I'm working. I try to think about life”. With
    him as inspiration, the music on the album took on a life of its own, continuing a conversation that, 30 years on
    from the artist’s death, is unfortunately still relevant today. Themes including such as identity, representation,
    social inequality weave through this collection of tracks, touching on dub, jazz, hip-hop, post-punk and ambient,
    though never settling on one style for too long.</p>

  <p class="flex-item"> Two years in the making and funded by Arts Council England, the album is the debut release on
    underground tastemaker platform Lonely Table, with support from music and arts enterprise The Vinyl Factory. The
    project was conceptualised and produced by Lonely Table co-founder Lexy Morvaridi and Anja Ngozi with the aim of
    demonstrating the intersection between different artistic mediums around a thematic purpose. </p>
  <p class="flex-item">Other artists featured include Maxwell Owin, Roxanne Tataei, Moroka, AJ Kwame, Kwake Bass,
    Wu-Lu, Lex Amor, Ego Ella May, and Confucius MC. Defying genre, the result is a sound that will resonate with the
    eclectic ears of contemporary listeners. Ranging from experimental electronic explorations to floor-filling foot
    shakers, reflecting the ever-expanding musical landscape that makes up the UK scene..</p>
  <p class="flex-item"> Alongside the album, Lonely Table and Anja Ngozi worked in partnership with Ruff Sqwad
    Foundation and Spotlight youth centre to further channel the creative spirit of Basquiat and nurture the talents of
    the next generation through a series of workshops. Together they gave seven BME young people aged 12-18 the
    opportunity to visit the Tate Modern and create music in response to what they saw. Two tracks were created as a
    result of these workshops, exploring the approach and ideals of Basquiat.</p>
